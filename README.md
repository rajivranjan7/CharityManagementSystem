# CHARITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Description
To provide a common platform for a Charity ecosystem extended to multiple cities (Network) for Donors, CSRs, Charities/ NGOs and the Admin management team
This application is also used to manage the funds, donation kits and managing the charitable events including fundraising
There is a level of escalation and management for each of the transactions and work request that are requested

## Problem Statement:
“Givers Never Lack!”, with this motto in mind we have created a scalable application that tackles the problem of managing funds and donations, all under a single platform.
Our platform integrates the Donors, CSRs, Event Coordinators and the Charity’s POC for a seamless workflow. The users can effortlessly see their transactions and can get a report on the total inventory for the managers and administrators.
Managing various Organizations under Enterprises can impose a great challenge especially in an area where there is lack of infrastructure or where there is lack of coordination.
